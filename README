#### Nix Configuration ####

This repository contains my personal configuration files written in Nix. I've recently switched to NixOS and I'm
enjoying the reproducible builds it offers while exploring and teaching myself the Nix build system. The majority of
configuration files in this repository originate from my dotfiles. The build leverages the Flakes experimental feature
to construct the NixOS system, installing and configuring all necessary programs and tools.

#### Project Structure ####

The project is structured as follows:

- **home:** This directory contains Nix modules for Home Manager.
- **hosts:** Here, you'll find configurations specific to each individual host.
- **modules:** This directory houses common/shared configuration files.

#### Build the System #####

In order to build the system and apply the defined configuration files, you can use rebuild.sh script or run the
following command:
    $ sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
